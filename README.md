## Overview
The C Parser Project is designed to understand and process the syntax of C programming language files. It breaks down the structure of the code, identifying various elements such as functions, loops, and variables.

## Features
- **Syntax Analysis**: Breaks down C code into understandable components.
- **Error Detection**: Highlights syntax errors and provides basic debugging information.
- **Extensibility**: Easily modifiable to add more parsing rules or extend functionality.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/egreenfield323/C-parser-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd C-parser-project
   ```
3. Build the project using a suitable compiler, such as `gcc` or `make`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   *Note: Ensure you have the necessary build tools installed.*

## Usage
To use the parser, run the compiled executable with a C source file as an argument:
```bash
./c-parser path/to/c-file.c
```
The parser will analyze the provided file and output details about its structure or report syntax errors.

### Example
```bash
./c-parser example.c
```

## Technologies Used
- **C**: The core language used for building the parser.
